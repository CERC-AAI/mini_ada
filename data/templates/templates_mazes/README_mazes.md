This folder contains templates of Maze bits. At this point, a Maze bit only connects with a Maze bit, which means if you want to build Mazes,you might want to consider specifying `/mini_ada/Minigrid/minigrid/templates/templates_mazes` as the only path to your layouts. It will still work if you do not, but it will lead to more time needed to generate a master map. This is due to the algorithm randomly choosing a layout among the directories you have provided, in order to add it to the master map at each step of the generational process, until the stopping criterion is met.


We intend to change this behaviour in a near future update.
